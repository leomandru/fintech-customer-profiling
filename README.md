# Data-driven Customer Segmentation for Financial Institutions/Fintechs

Starting from an anonymized dataset representing some financial institution/fintech's customers, through unsupervised learning techniques (i.e., clustering), we have done a data-driven customer segmentation in order to obtain the personas that better correspond to the clients' profiles.

The project is developed in both Matlab and Python languages.

# Data-driven Customer Segmentation for Financial Institutions/Fintechs

Starting from an anonymized dataset representing some financial institution/fintech's customers, through unsupervised learning techniques (i.e., clustering), we have done a data-driven customer segmentation in order to obtain the personas that better correspond to the clients' profiles.

In the main folder you can find the .xlsx file of the dataset and 2 folders containing the Python & Matlab developed code.

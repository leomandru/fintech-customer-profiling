# Data-driven Customer Segmentation for Financial Institutions/Fintechs

Starting from an anonymized dataset representing some financial institution/fintech's customers, through unsupervised learning techniques (i.e., clustering), we have done a data-driven customer segmentation in order to obtain the personas that better correspond to the clients' profiles.

The main foldercontains the dataset .xlsx file, the dependencies for the Binder Jupyter Notebook and 2 folders containing the Python & Matlab developed code.
